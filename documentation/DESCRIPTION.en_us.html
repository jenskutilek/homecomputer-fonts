Sixtyfour and Workbench fonts are inspired by the article Raster CRT Typography (According to DEC) by Norbert Landsteiner. They are a rework on some old pixel versions of the Commodore 64 and Amiga Workbench fonts I had done years ago. They include now two custom axes: <i>Scanlines</i>, that allows to controls the height of the lines, and as a result of this, the amount of vertical space between the lines. And <i>Bleed</i> to change the amount of horizontal bleed of the pixels due to the phosphor latency found in CRT displays.

Due to the specifity of this project, and the historical origin of the fonts, the font only supports a limited set of glyphs.
