# Homecomputer Fonts

Variable fonts based on the Commodore 64 and [Amiga fonts](https://github.com/jenskutilek/homecomputer-fonts-wb).

Inspired by the article [Raster CRT Typography (According to DEC)](https://www.masswerk.at/nowgobang/2019/dec-crt-typography) by Norbert Landsteiner, I reworked some old pixel versions of the Commodore 64 and Amiga Workbench fonts I had done years ago to include variable font axes for the size of the horizontal scanlines and the amount of horizontal bleed of the pixels due to the phosphor latency found in CRT displays.

Download the fonts and source files from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jenskutilek/homecomputer-fonts).
