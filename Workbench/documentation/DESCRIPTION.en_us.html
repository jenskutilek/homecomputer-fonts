    The Homecomputer Fonts are inspired by the interface fonts of two classic
    1980s computers, the Commodore C64 (Sixtyfour) and Amiga
    (Workbench). Jens Kutilek adapted them the the variable font
    technology. He did not just convert the pixel fonts, but tried to emulate
    the artifacts of rendering letters on a CRT screen. The width of the CRT
    scan lines and the horizontal bleed of the pixels can be controlled via
    variation axes.
