This folder contains the Glyphs files with masters that are not part of the exported fonts. The files may be of interest if you want to add glyphs or modify the fonts in any other way.

For exporting the final fonts, only the Glyphs files in `Sixtyfour/sources` and `Workbench/sources` should be used.

**Master 1** contains horizontal lines with the original pixel drawing in the background:

**Master 2** has the thinnest scan lines with no bleed to the left or right:

**Master 3** has the thickest scan lines with no bleed. The lines are still extended to the left and right in comparison to master 2 for reasons of optical correction:

**Master 4** has the thinnest scan lines with maximum bleed to the left and right:

**Master 5** has the thickest scan lines with maximum bleed to the left and right:

**Master 6** contains the old outlined pixel font that the reworked font is based on:

The scan line elements are manually drawn quadratic (TrueType) curves. In the production source files, those curves are cubic BÃ©zier curves (PostScript curves), because the build process with `fontmake` will try to remove overlaps for static font export, and this is only supported for cubic curves. So the curves are automatically converted from PostScript to TrueType in the final fonts, which makes them a tiny bit less optimized than the hand-drawn curves here.
